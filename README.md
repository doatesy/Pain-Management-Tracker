# Pain-Management-Tracker
Simple HTML/JS app for tracking pain on the body using browser database. Utilizes Jquery &amp; Twitter Bootstrap

For easy tracking of pain in the body for future analysis.  

Reports to be added to this at some point.

# Running the App
Download all files, and open the index.html file in a modern browser (firefox, chrome, Edge).  

It should be fairly self explanatory from there.

Please note there are a number of things that are not working at this stage.

Inputing points into the chart works... And thats about it.
