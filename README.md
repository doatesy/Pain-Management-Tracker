# Running the App
Download all files, and open the index.html file in a modern browser (firefox, chrome, Edge).  

It should be fairly self explanatory from there.

Please note there are a number of things that are not working at this stage.

Inputing points into the chart works, editing of pain points works, generating some very basic reports works, and multi user mode works.
